# Header files

Put simply, header files contain declarations for a specific file. Think `index.d.ts` in typescript.
You would import these files when you want variables, constants, functions, etc. from other files.
Note, header files do not contain the implementation just the declaration. The actual implementation can 
be found in the corresponsing `.cpp` file (declaration files have the `.h` file type)
