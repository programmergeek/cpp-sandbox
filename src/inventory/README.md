# Inventory Mangement

## Outline
This is a simple inventory system that allows users to create an account and add some perosnal information to it. 
Returning should be able to login to the system, view and edit any previously entered information. It should be able to keep track of what items are in the inventory, when items are removed from inventory, and when they are restocked.
